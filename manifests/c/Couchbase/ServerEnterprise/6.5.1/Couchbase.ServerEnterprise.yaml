ShortDescription: Couchbase.ServerEnterprise
Description: The Enterprise edition (EE) represents the latest, most stable, production-ready release of Couchbase Server. We recommend the Enterprise Edition binaries for commercial production systems running Couchbase Server. The Enterprise Edition contains some unique features that make it the best fit for production deployments running in data centers or a public cloud infrastructure. Use of EE in development and test environments is free. EE requires a paid subscription for production use. Our paid annual subscriptions for EE include a commercial license, better availability capabilities, enhanced security features, advanced tooling and higher performance and scale. It also includes technical support with service level commitments via our 24x7 support organization and hot fixes for releases. One important principle for CE and EE is to ensure full portability of applications between two editions. The capabilities ensure that an application running on EE should simply transition to CE without code changes and visa versa.
